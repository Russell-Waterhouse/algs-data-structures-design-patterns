# Design Patterns

This directory in this project contains Design Patterns.
Each folder represents a different design pattern.
Each data structure has the following:
1. A README explaining the design pattern, how it works, and where 
the design pattern is commonly used.
2. A folder for each implementation of that design pattern, labelled by 
programming language.

Each implementation folder contains the following:
1. The actual implementation of the design pattern.
2. A test file, which shows how the components of the design pattern 
fit together and work together.
3. A `Dockerfile`, which will run the tests and print their output. 
This is done so that everyone can run my examples without me having to 
explain how to install rust, gcc, ghc, go, etc. on Windows, Mac, Ubuntu,
Arch, Fedora, Debian, RHEL, etc.
