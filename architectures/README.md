# Architectures

This directory in this project contains Architectures.
Each folder represents a different architectures.
Each architecture directory has the following:
1. A README explaining the architecture, how it works, and where 
the architecture is commonly used.
2. A folder for each implementation of that architecture, labelled by 
programming language.

Each implementation folder contains the following:
1. The actual implementation, complete with components for a whole
working system using that architecture.
2. A test file, which shows how the components of that architecture
work together to accomplish a task.
3. A `Dockerfile`, which will run the tests and print their output. 
This is done so that everyone can run my examples without me having to 
explain how to install rust, gcc, ghc, go, etc. on Windows, Mac, Ubuntu,
Arch, Fedora, Debian, RHEL, etc.
