# Algorithms

This directory in this project contains data structures.
Each folder represents a different data structure. 
Each data structure has the following:
1. A README explaining the algorithm, how it works, time complexity, and where 
the algorithm is commonly used.
2. A folder for each implementation of that algorithm, labelled by 
programming language.

Each implementation folder contains the following:
1. The actual implementation, complete with functions for all the basic 
operations supported by that algorithm.
2. A test file, which shows how the operations on the algorithm  
are used.
3. A `Dockerfile`, which will run the tests and print their output. 
This is done so that everyone can run my examples without me having to 
explain how to install rust, gcc, ghc, go, etc. on Windows, Mac, Ubuntu,
Arch, Fedora, Debian, RHEL, etc.
