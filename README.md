# algs-data-structures-design-patterns
Algorithms, Data Structures, and Design Patterns in numerous programming languages

## Why?

### Why Would You Put Algorithms, Algorithms, Data Structures, Design Patterns, and Software Architectures in the Same Repository?

Because they're all tools that software engineers use to get repeated results.
They're all in the same toolbox. They're all tools that I can reach for to 
get repeatable results when I see a problem I recognize.

### Why Would You Do All of These Multiple Times in Multiple Programming Languages?

There are two reasons that I did that.
1. I wanted to show that these tools aren't just for people using technology X.
I've found people that think that design patterns are just for java devs, or 
algorithms only matter in high-performance computing, and I believe that to be 
wrong.
2. I want to show how different language features lend themselves more or less
to different design patterns. For example, the default list implementation 
in python very easily makes a stack, whereas you must create your own list
implementation in C first. I want to demonstrate these kinds of differences.

## Disclaimers

1. I offer no guarantee of the correctness or completeness of anything 
in this repository. If you copy-paste my incomplete buggy code into 
your production code base, break something, and get fired, that's on you.
2. I STRONGLY discourage using this repository to cheat on programming 
assignments. I have taken the time to create and maintain this repository 
because my career as a software engineer has taught me that these tools
are necessary to understand. Please do use my work as a reference in your 
own learning, but don't just copy-paste it for a grade.
