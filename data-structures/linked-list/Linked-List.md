# Linked List


## Introducition 

A Linked List is a linear data structure where elements are
not stored in contiguous memory locations. Instead, each node in the list
contains a data item and a reference (link) to the next node in the sequence.
This structure allows for efficient insertions and deletions at any position in
the list.

## Operations

| Operation | Efficiency |
|-----------|------------|
| `insertHead(data)` | O(1) |
| `insertTail(data)` | O(n) |
| `deleteNode(Node)` | O(n) |
| `printList()`      | O(n) |
| `size()`           | O(n) |
