# Stack Data Structure

## Introduction 

A stack is a fundamental data structure in computer science that operates on
the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle. It is a collection of elements with
two main operations: push and pop. Stacks are widely used in various
applications, including expression evaluation, function call management, undo
mechanisms, and more. Understanding the stack data structure and its operations
is essential for anyone working with algorithms and data structures.

## Operations

| Operation          | Efficiency |
|--------------------|------------|
| `push(item)`       | O(1)       |
| `pop()`            | O(1)       |
| `peek()`           | O(1)       |
| `isEmpty()`        | O(1)       |
| `size()`           | O(1)       |

## How It Works

A stack can be thought of as a collection of elements in which two main
operations are performed:

1. **Push**: Adding an element to the top of the stack. This is also known as
   "pushing" an element onto the stack.

2. **Pop**: Removing the top element from the stack. When you "pop" an element,
   it is removed from the stack.

3. **Peek**: Viewing the top element without removing it. It's a way to inspect
   the top element without altering the stack's structure.

4. **isEmpty**: Checking if the stack is empty. This operation returns `true`
   if there are no elements on the stack and `false` otherwise.

5. **Size**: Determining the number of elements in the stack. It returns the
   count of elements currently in the stack.

## When Should It Be Used?

Stacks are useful in various scenarios, such as:

1. **Function Call Management**: In programming languages, function calls are
   managed using a call stack. When a function is called, its context is pushed
   onto the stack, and when it returns, it's popped. This mechanism allows for
   function nesting and maintaining the order of return.

2. **Expression Evaluation**: Stacks are used to evaluate expressions,
   particularly in languages that use postfix (Reverse Polish Notation) or
   infix notations. They can help in parsing and computing the result of
   complex expressions.

3. **Undo/Redo Functionality**: Stacks can be employed to implement undo and
   redo operations in applications. Each change is pushed onto the stack, and
   undoing a change involves popping from the stack.

4. **Backtracking Algorithms**: Algorithms that require backtracking, such as
   depth-first search, can use a stack to manage the state and facilitate
   exploration of alternative paths.

5. **Browser History**: Stacks can be used to manage browser history, enabling
   users to navigate backward and forward through visited web pages.

6. **Parentheses Matching**: Stacks are often used to check if parentheses,
   brackets, and braces in an expression are properly balanced.

7. **Memory Management**: Stacks are crucial in low-level programming for
   managing memory allocation and deallocation. Function call frames are
   typically stored in a stack.

8. **Undo/Redo Functionality**: Stacks are commonly used in applications to
   implement undo and redo functionality. Each state change is pushed onto the
   stack, allowing users to navigate backward and forward through previous
   actions.

## Notes

- Stacks are often implemented using arrays or linked lists. The choice of
  implementation depends on the specific requirements of the application.
- Stacks have a variety of real-world analogies, such as a stack of plates or a
  call stack in programming languages.

Understanding the stack data structure and its operations is fundamental to
solving many algorithmic problems and is widely used in computer science and
software development.
