# Data Structures

This directory in this project contains data structures.
Each folder represents a different data structure. 
Each data structure has the following:
1. A README explaining the data structure
2. A folder for each implementation of that data structure, labelled by 
programming language.

Each implementation folder contains the following:
1. The actual implementation, complete with functions for all the basic 
operations supported by that data structure.
2. A test file, which shows how the operations on the data structure 
are used.
3. A `Dockerfile`, which will run the tests and print their output. 
This is done so that everyone can run my examples without me having to 
explain how to install rust, gcc, ghc, go, etc. on Windows, Mac, Ubuntu,
Arch, Fedora, Debian, RHEL, etc.
